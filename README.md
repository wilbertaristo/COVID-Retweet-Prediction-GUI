# COVID-Retweet-Prediction-GUI
A GUI for running COVID retweet prediction model. Made for SUTD Term 8 AI Project. 

## Important!
**If you are recreating this GUI locally, please clone the `local_recreation` branch instead of the `master` branch and make sure to boot up the [local backend server]( https://github.com/wilbertaristo/COVID_Retweet_Prediction_Backend) before running this GUI!**

## Procedure
To recreate this GUI locally in your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `local_recreation` branch.
2. Open your terminal and cd into the repository.
3. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
4. Run `yarn` if you are using yarn or `npm install` if you are using npm. Wait until all packages are installed.
5. Make sure the local Flask server is already loaded up before proceeding to the next step. (complete ALL steps from [Backend section](https://github.com/wilbertaristo/COVID_Retweet_Prediction_Backend))
6. Run `yarn dev` if you are using yarn or `npm run dev` if you are using npm. The GUI should load up in your default browser in a while.
